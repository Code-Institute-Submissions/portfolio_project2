<h2>Features</h2>

This is a one page web app. It is created with minimalist style in mind. Thus, there are no extra snippets of info nor are there any unnecessary distractions.

Since it is a quiz app, it's a belief of this coder that player should be able to focus without being distracted by busy work on sceen. 

The main features of the page are:

Container - it is the box within which the game takes place. 

Buttons - they are a two feature component. There is a text inside whith answers and naturally they are clickable.

Score counter - there is a small score counter at the top left corner of the container. Which counts only the correct answers.

Background - though there are no images, the background is a visual clue to a player. Its neutral state has a gray color. Once a player picks an answer the background changes colors, green for correct answer and red for wrong.
