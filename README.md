<h1>Quiz - Portfolio project 2</h1>

This is a minimalist style quiz created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's aim is to test player's general knowledge. There are questions on a variety 

of topics, ranging from animals to history. 

This game does not contain any graphics content therefore it is not age restricted.

<h2>Features</h2>

This is a one page web app. It is created with minimalist style in mind. Thus, there are no extra snippets of info nor are there any unnecessary distractions.

Since it is a quiz app, it's a belief of this coder that player should be able to focus without being distracted by busy work on sceen. 

The main features of the page are:

Container - it is the box within which the game takes place. 

Buttons - they are a two feature component. There is a text inside whith answers and naturally they are clickable.

Score counter - there is a small score counter at the top left corner of the container. Which counts only the correct answers.

Background - though there are no images, the background is a visual clue to a player. Its neutral state has a gray color. Once a player picks an answer the background changes colors, green for correct answer and red for wrong.

<h2>Bugs and Changes</h2>

This project proved to be quite challenging. This was my first work using javascript. I have ecnountered numerous bugs throughout. The general layout had

also been changed a number of times. 

The process of writing code for the buttons to accept the correct answers was the biggest challenge. 

The second difficulty I had encountered was keeping the score. The increment functions would not work correctly.

After deploying the project it would not load correctly to screen. <a href="[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/](https://medium.com/@fbnlsr/how-to-get-rid-of-the-
flash-of-unstyled-content-d6b79bf5d75f)">Flash Of Unstyled Content</a> was the cause of the bug, and this article helped 

solve the issue.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">HTML5</a> - provides the general structure of the sie.

<a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html">CSS</a> - provides the styling.

<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/">JavaScript</a> - game's logic.

<a href="https://www.gitpod.io/#get-started">GitPod</a> - used to deploy the site.

<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> - used to host/edit the site.

<h2>Deployment</h2>

The site was deployed to GitHub pages taking the following steps:

1. In the repository of GitHub, navigate to the Settings tab.
2. In the Settings tab, on the left side navigate to the Pages tab.
3. Under Source, select the branch to master and click save.
4. Shortly after a message will appear with a link to the deplyed site (It might take a few moments for the link to function).

<h2>Credits</h2>  

Parts of the code were taken from the Code Institute <a href="https://mvv1790.github.io/love-running/">Love Maths</a> Project. 

I have had to follow a few tutorials by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified">Web Dev Simplified</a>, this is where the main chunk 

of game's logic came from. In additioin I followed a few tutorials by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsKsymTY_4BYR-wytLjex7A">Brian Design</a> as 

well. This was done to gain a better understanding of javascript and to look at different approaches to programming. 

For many general references I used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>
